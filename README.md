# photo-effect-using-image-processing

In today’s world various types of apps are available which 
provides face filters e.g. Snapchat provides filters like Altitude 
Overlay, Brighten, Location Overlay, and not only Snapchat but 
also many apps which provides image filters. People are using all 
types of image filters for fun but behind every filter, there is some 
logic present. Filters are not only used for fun but also it has used 
for various types of applications e.g., edge detection the Canny edge 
is used, and Gaussian blur for smoothing the image, etc. This study
paper projected the system for applying the Photo effect on 
different types of images using almost image processing techniques. 
The proposed system is the group of different sorts of algorithms. 
the system is based on Canny edge, Bilateral filter, Gaussian Blur 
and median Blur which means it has multiple functionalities that’s 
why the given system is different. Given system have some 
limitations also like user cant adjust the threshold value.
